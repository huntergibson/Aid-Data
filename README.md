## What did I learn?
Working with Excel and Tableau to analyze aid data has provided me with invaluable insights into the realm of data analysis and visualization. Excel's versatility has allowed me to efficiently manage and manipulate large datasets, perform complex calculations, and streamline data preprocessing tasks. On the other hand, Tableau's intuitive interface and powerful visualization capabilities have enabled me to create compelling dashboards and reports that effectively communicate key findings and trends. This experience has emphasized the importance of leveraging the strengths of both tools to extract actionable insights from data, demonstrating how their integration can significantly enhance the analytical process and decision-making capabilities in various domains beyond GitHub.
